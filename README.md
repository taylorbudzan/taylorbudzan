### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Software developer with an interest in C#, ASP.Net Core and now Blazor.  Goal is to build up my reository with different projects in order to expande my knowledge and understanding of C# / .Net Programming.

What got me interested in programming was my love of video games. My current project will blend this love and my new interest in Blazor to see what the posibilities are! I'm going to start off small and expand on my games in increments.

My initial game list is:
- Tic-Tac-Toe
- Minesweeper

More to come! Any suggestions are welcome.
